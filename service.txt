Services in Angular:
- A service is a typescript class which contains businuss logic which can be reused in the application by injecting into component.
- In Angular service will contain reusable functions,which we can inject into components, directives and also Pipes.
- Services follow singleton pattern, which means one object is created and same object  is used in every request of service.
- In Angular to create a service we use "@Injectable()".
- Using Angular CLI to create a service we use "ng g s <servicename>".
- We can inject the service in 3 ways
    - Global(Angular 8)
    - Module Level
    - Component Level
